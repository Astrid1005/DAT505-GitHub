# There are two projects in the session3.

## Introduction

* S3-00-exercise-Basicstructure-GUI
The project is an exercise which required me to creat GUI in the scene. People can control the data of the cube across the GUI. The scale and position and rotation of the cube can be controlled.

* S3-Homework-09.03.2019
The project is a homework which required me to creat some artistic things in the scene. The inspiration of the project is colourful glasses in the church. I created three CircleBufferGeometries and a lot of TorusGeometries and set them to different positions to make them look artistic. I also made each CircleBufferGeometry rotate in different direction meanwhile I made each TorusGeometry be motionless, which made the project's layers be luxuriant.
