# There are three projects in the session4.

## Introduction

* S4-00-exercise-ArrayMesh

The project is an exercise which required me to creat a three dimensional grid of objects, and position them accordingly in the scene. Then the exercise also required me to make every adjacent eight objects to be one kind of color and make each object rotate in the scene.

* S4-01-exercise-ArrayMesh

The project is an exercise which required me to creat a three dimensional grid of objects, and position them accordingly in the scene. Then the exercise also required me to make every adjacent eight objects to be one kind of color and make each object rotate in the scene. The difference in this time, each object not only rotates in the same direction and speed, but also becomes bigger and bigger all the time.

* S4-Homework-12.03.2019

The project is a homework which required me to creat a two dimensional grid of objects, and position them accordingly in the scene. Then the homework also required me to make each object be in random rotations and have random color in the scene. All objects are motionless in random rotations in the scene.
