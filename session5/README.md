# There are three projects in the session5.

## Introduction

* S5-01-exercise-random-14.03.19

The project is an exercise which required me to creat a two dimensional grid of objects, and position them accordingly in the scene. Then the exercise also required me to make each object be in random rotations and random speed, meanwhile objects were required to have random color in the scene. All objects are in random rotation loop.
