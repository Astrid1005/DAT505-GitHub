# There are three projects in the session5.

## Introduction

* S5-01-exercise-random-14.03.19

The project is an exercise which required me to creat a two dimensional grid of objects, and position them accordingly in the scene. Then the exercise also required me to make each object be in random rotations and random speed, meanwhile objects were required to have random color in the scene. All objects are in random rotation loop.

* S5-02-exercise-random-14.03.19

The project is an exercise which required me to creat a two dimensional grid of objects, and position them accordingly in the scene. Then the exercise also required me to make the special objects be in random rotation and random speed, meanwhile other objects were required to be white and motionless in the scene.

* S5-03-exercise-random-14.03.19

The project is an exercise which required me to creat a two dimensional grid of objects, and position them accordingly in the scene. Then the exercise also required me to make the special objects be in random color and special shape, meanwhile other objects were required to be white. The difference in this project is that each object's scale was required to become bigger still to the limit and then become to the original scale.

* S5-04-exercise-random-14.03.19

The project is an exercise which required me to creat a two dimensional grid of objects, and position them accordingly in the scene. Then the exercise also required me to make the all objects be in random rotation and random speed, meanwhile I needed to give special cubes special material.
