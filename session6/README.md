## Introduction

* S6-exercise-CityScape-full-16.03.2019

The project is an exercise which required me to creat a view of scene likes the following pictures were given by teacher. Then I created a lot of motionless wireframe white cubes to simulate the view of the pictures. People can have a first person view in this project. They can move the mouse to control the view to see the whole scene.
